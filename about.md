This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine. 
===


Thoughts, projects, experimental thought projects.

I write about all, some, or none of the above. Maybe even something completly different. 

Where will it take me? I don't know. 

Will I still be me when I come out the other side? I don't know. 

What is the other side? Is there even an _other side_? I don't know.

I might not have answers, but I have questions.

Will this blog have both? I don't know.

This is my blog. I must master it as I master my life. My blog, without me, is useless.

Without my blog I am just talking to myself...
